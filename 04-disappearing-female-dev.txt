THE DISAPPEARING FEMALE DEVELOPER?

Programmers are easy to stereotype. They sit around in their hoody all hunch backed, questionable hygiene, they spoke to a girl - once - it didn't go well. Yeah, Sally's still creeped out about that... you need to APOLOGIZE! They take a serious position in the trekkers vs trekkies debate. They know what the trekkers vs trekkies debate is. 

We went out and polled a bunch of coders and, turns out, these stereotypes are all true. Every one of them. Totally true. (Haha, no.)

But one stereotype in particular keeps this lady coder up at night. There are two kinds of people: there are programmers and then there are women.

[intro]

Welcome to CompChomp, the only place on the internets where code is cuter than puppies. Aww, I changed my mind.

Coding is actually a field with a history of key women figures. Ada Lovelace - the first computer programmer. Not the first female programmer, literally the first programmer. Grace Hopper, who created the first compiler. (Those are kind of important in programming. They're actually a big deal.) Oh and she’s the one to thank for the terms “bug” and “debug”. The ladies of ENIAC, who moved 80 tons of hardware in heels. (I can barely walk in heels.) But notice something? Nothing going on here since Russia started shaving its leaders.

Now it’s a field where the percentage of women just struggles to keep up.

STATS ALERT! Woowooh! These are my stats glasses. When the glasses come out, you know the stats are gonna be good.

From 2008 to 2009, 57% of US undergraduate degrees went to women. They earned 42% of the degrees in math and 40% of the degrees in physical sciences, but only 18% of computer science degrees. Fast forward to 2013-2014. Do things get better? The same really... except in computer science, where the womens dropped to 13%. Oh yeah, and that was down from a high of 38% in the 80s. Say what you will about the 80s, but they gave us female developers and taught us that chartreuse, purple and pink go together.

It's not much better in the workforce - something like 20% women. Unless you’re watching this from Silicon Valley, where women fill only 12% of those glitzy startup dev jobs. (Hey, we like pingpong, too!) [techrepublic]

On a positive note, there's game development, where from 2009 to 2014 the percentage of women doubled. Amazing! Until you realize that doubling meant rising from 1 in 10 to 1 out of every 5, on par with the rest of the dev world. [IGDA 2014]

These stats are depressing. (That's a lot of numbers.) I'm taking my glasses off. Look, at the end of the day, what I want to know is why more girls like me aren't coding.

So, maybe code isn't interesting? Oh, really? See this? This is an Update() loop I wrote for a game. This part makes a cube dance around while his color changes to the music. You can make colorful dancing cubes till the cows come home! Then you, too, can learn that most colors are some shade of brown! (I really thought it would be rainbows! So many rainbows!)

Don't think it's something girls do? I hear you. A couple years ago, I was sitting at my desk punching numbers into a spreadsheet optimizing those ROIs. (That's return on investment.) But now I write stuff that turns those numbers into floating bubbles.

Is code weird and unlearnable? Well, I started taking online classes for fun, and that was alright. But it really started to make sense when I found a question I wanted to answer: the Monty Hall problem. A game show where you choose either to switch doors or stick with your original door. I walked a computer through it step by step, 100,000 times. I still don't get it, but I can assure you it's just better to switch doors. (Don't ask. Just do it!) This was the first code I ever wrote totally on my own. I just wanted to answer a question.

And that's what code does. It isn’t about guys or girls. It’s about your world, a world that is becoming codier and codier: self-driving cars, robots breeding humans, passwords that aren't even words anymore, the wacky stuff that happens while your favorite video game runs Update() 60 frames per second. Or, for some reason, 30 frames a second. (Hide your frame-locking shame!)

You can do this. Girl. You can do this. Guy. You can do this. Sad depressed puppy. Okay, no, you can’t do this. But you can sit next to me while I do this! There are lots of problems to solve and jobs to fill. Whoever you are, wherever you are, your world is made of code. Maybe, if you step up, that’ll be one less disappearing female developer.

Now get out there and code. Chomp!

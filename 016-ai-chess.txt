3/23 - All Your Games are Belong to Us Pt 1
DeepBlue - chess (2/10/1996 - first computer win against top human, 11/1/2005 - last top human win against computer)
Watson - jeopardy (other applications like medical diagnostics)
 
3/30 - All Your Games are Belong to Us Pt 2
AlphaGo - go (was considered the toughest to win - https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1002:_Game_AIs)
  - as recently as 1 year ago, computer experts thoguht we were still 10 year away from building a computer that could defeat GO champions
  - best algos could easily be beaten by moderately good players
Why so tough to beat?
  - There are games (like tic-tac-toe) that have a finite number of possible moves.  These games generally have mathematical solutions and are considered 'solved'
  - Chess had too many potential games for it to be a 'solved' game but some pieces were more valuable than others so it could choose the best 2-3 moves and play out possible games for those moves (then select the best overall move)
  - Go had more possible game combos than there are atoms in the known universe AND all pieces had the same value so it couldn't be 'won' in that way
How did we solve it?
  - Combination of 'deep learning' and 'monte carlo tree search'
  - Deep Learning
    - Give computer basic rules of a game and have it play over and over and over while it abstracts out strategies and best practices
    - Seeded with a number of base games (30 million?)
    - Played against a modified version of itself that had been trained to make the most likely human moves

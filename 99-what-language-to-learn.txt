Begs question - for what? What are you trying to achieve?
 * Get a taste of programming

 * Data Science

Some languages to mention?
 - java (good for compsci, but tougher to learn)
 - c# (video games/enterprise)
 - javascript / php (get started right away for web)
 - ruby / python (beginner friendly, need frameworks to do anything web)
 - objc (iphone apps, but tough to learn)
 - swift (iphone apps, more friendly, changes a lot)
 - c (toughest guy in the room, will kill the beginners soul)

Make analogy to natural language
 - Don't ask what first language to learn
 - generally learn the one in the household your born into
 - interesting if you were born into computer programming languages
  * I'm from a Ruby household but my husband's family are C developers so I've been having to learn a new language to talk to them
 - Like language, it's a tool for communicating
 - Most important thing to do is start

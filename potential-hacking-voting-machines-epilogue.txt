## Notes ##
2017 DefCon conference included "Voting Village" 30 voting machines from major creators (Diebold, Sequoia, WinVote) that were availble to be hacked
	- some took apart physically and noted the vulnerabilites
	- some were hacked wirelessly
	- first few vulnerabilites found in first 90 minutes (all were new)
How'd they get them:
	- bought on ebay
	- purchased at government auctions
What were the issues:
	- Some ran outdated software (including unpatched OpenSSL, Windows XP, Windows CE)
		- MS03-026 vulnerability in WinXP, allowing infosec academic Carsten Schurmann to access the machine from his laptop using RDP.  access would enable him to change the vote tally from anywhere
		- OpenSSL bug CVE-2011-4109
	- poorly secured wifi connectivity
	- admin passwords available on Google
	- unsecured SQL databases with unsanitized SQL inputs coming in
	- Voting System Technician training manual online includes password and how to log in
Criticism:
	- Some of the machines were not fully secured (the way the manufacturers direct them to be by county officials)
	- Some of the hacks would have been detected and logged
	- Some of the machines are no longer in use in elections (1 model was decomissioned all others still active)
Extra:
	- a ExpressPoll-5000 electronic poll book (used to check voters in) from Tennessee hadn't been wiped before being sold and data from over 650,000 voters was still on the machine
		- included name, address, birthday, political party, whether they voted absentee, whether they were asked to show id
		- file was on a removable memory card, data was not incrypted or password protected
		- If someone had access before election, could alter it to make it appear that people had already voted absentee which would prevent them from voting on election day
		- Georgia special election 4 were stolen from poll managers truck when he stopped for groceries
	- got a WinVote to RickRoll people
Evidence that election systems in 21 states were targeted by cyber attacks
	- does not appear that any votes were changed
	- unclear what (if any) data they were able to hack
Follow Up On:
	- In one case study, the company found a poll worker in Virginia had hacked the machine so she could play Minesweeper on it.
Some safeguards:
	- Govt certifies vendors/equipment
	- Independent hardware/software evaluation
	- Voter-verified paper audit trail
	- Mandatory recounts (automatic audit of some fraction of precinct results)
	- Parallel testing for proper behavior
		- some mahcines pulled from service on election day and run in a simulated election
None of this includes back end attacks:
	- hacking into voter databases to change/steal information (changes could delay someone's ability to checkin/vote)
	- targeting specific employees with backend access using spear phishing attack (get them to click on a link in an email so you have access to the network)
Recommendations:
	- Retire old/outdated voting machines
		- known vulnerabilities should be patched
		- all machines should have a paper trail for auditing
	- Secure voter registration systems and voter databases against hacking attacks
		- encrypt databases
		- use proper passwords and ensure passwords are kept secret
	- Require risk limiting audits for any precinct that uses electronic voting machines
		- take random, representative samples of the paper trail and audit them for accuracy
	- Adjust the rules of procurement and maintenance of election voting systems
		- require continuous delivery/installation of security patches
	- Improve training of polling station staff
		- Election officials need to be able to handle cryptographic keys and to protect them in the face of social engineering and other hacking attacks
		- Could be largely done by 1-day IT conference

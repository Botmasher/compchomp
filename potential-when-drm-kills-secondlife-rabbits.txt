In January of 2010, a company called Ozimals launched a new offering in the online virtual world Second Life - adorable, colorful bunnies. The rabbits were a game item known as a breedable.  After purchasing them from Ozimals, owners could 'breed' their rabbits and create rabbits which they could keep or sell.  Ozimals rabbits were the first breedable product that utilized genetic principles in determining what the offspring would look like.  This made the bunnies very popular.

But if the rabbits you've sold breed like....rabbits....how do you keep your bunny selling business from going under? To ensure they'd make money off every rabbit whether it was purchased from Ozimals or not, they programmed the rabbits to be hungry.  

This was a powerful hunger...too powerful for regular old digital carrots.  This hunger needed special DRM-laced food that you could only get from Ozimals. Each rabbit had to connect with the Ozimals' server regularly. If they had the DRM-food in their stomach when they connected, they'd get a 72-hour reprieve.  If the bunnies didn't have a belly full of Ozimals brand rabbit food, they'd fall into a coma.  And the only prescription was more Ozimals food.

This is a form of "digital rights management" (DRM to its frenemies).  The goal of most DRM is to keep you from making a million perfect copies of a game or movie so no one buys it from the publisher.  Way back in the day (the 80s....I'm talking about the 80s) data was a bit more physical.  Your Top Gun VHS had a magnetic tape with the audio and sweet sweet video physically encoded.  Every time you watched the tape....you lost some fidelity.  Every time you made a copy of the tape....same deal.  They might not have loved having people make copies but there was no risk of infinite perfect clones.  Digital changed everything.

<<you know DRM because of this one thing...give me reason to care first....give the examples up front and then tell them what it is>>
If you've ever had to enter a 2000 digit key to access your game, been told that you had 0 of 1 installs remaining or not been able to stream your favorite shows on your new laptop because you've already connected too many other devices, you've experienced DRM.

Publishers say it's necessary to stay profitable enough to continue making the software, music and movies that people love.  Critics (like Stallman here) say that it does very little to stop thieves and instead hurts the people that bought legitimate copies. At their worst, some DRM approaches can result in people losing access to digital media they purchased fair and square.

And, that's exactly what happened with the bunnies.

Ozimals had been plagued with legal battles almost from the beginning. After years of maneuvering (including claiming that Ozimals the company was completely separate from Ozimals the game), they reached the end of the road.  On Tuesday May 16, 2017 a post titled "Cease and Desist" was posted to the Ozimals blog. They stated that they were legally required to stop everything relating to Ozimals.  This included turning off the servers that the bunnies had to check in with to ensure they'd eaten their DRM-food.  A small number of "Everlasting" rabbits whose owners had traded their ability to breed for a DRM-free existence would continue on.  For the rest of them, all hope was gone.

Wednesday morning, the servers were turned off.

By Saturday, the last of the bunnies finished digesting their 72-hour DRM kibble and fell into a deep sleep they'd never be able to wake up from.

It seems even our digital worlds aren't safe from man-made extinctions.

CHOMP!!!!!

NB: Consider starting with a story about making a mix tape and use that to talk about DRM

Digital rights management (DRM to its frenemies) has always been a bit annoying. Find the 300-digit number on the back of the game box and enter it before you can play the game. Messed up a digit? Start over again at digit 1! Frustrating, but doable. What happens though when DRM becomes deadly?

A long time ago, music and movies were stored on analog media like cassette tapes. It was simple to make a copy of a song for your friend - just get the double cassette tape deck and boom! Publishers didn’t like this, but, they weren’t too worried. After all, every copy you made was just a little worse than before. Heck! Every time you played your tape (whether it was a copy or the original, it lost some of it’s magic. They knew you’d eventually be back to buy more.

Then the worst thing in the world happened. Digital.

Now, you could take your sweet Pentium 386 computer with the built in CD burner and burn infinite, high quality copies of your favorite song. Well, not infinite....those read/write CDs weren't cheap! But still, the Jess Mix was going global.

Publishers were in a quandry! They needed a way to ensure that one CD or DVD purchase didn't turn into millions of perfect copies.  DRM to the rescue.

Digital Rights Management encompasses a whole range of tactics publishers have for limiting access to their intellectual property.  If you've ever purchased a computer game and had to enter a 16-digit key in order to gain access to the program, you've done the DRM dance.  Perhaps you've connected your new phone to a music platform and been told that you can only connect 1 other device...or you've burnt a CD of songs only to discover they won't play because they're missing key data. That's all DRM.

One method whose popularity has grown hand in hand with the popularity of the internet is 'Always On'. With 'always on' you have to periodically communicate with a computer server to ensure you have the right to continue using the program.

<<Maybe XBOX One career killer joke here?>>

That's the process that the Ozimal's development team used for the bunnies they created for Second Life (the virtual world created by Linden Labs).  It turns out that virtual people love pets just as much as real people.  Ozimals filled the binary holes in people's digital hearts with digital bunnies. No longer bound by the rules of genetics, the bunnies had an array of wild and crazy fur colors. Pet owners could breed their digital rabbits and create new and interesting fur patterns.  If you loved it, you could keep it, if not, sell it to another second lifer and get some cold hard cash.

Of course, if you allow your digital rabbits to breed like....rabbits....you'd quickly go out of business. To ensure that they'd make money off of rabbits whether they were purchased from Ozimals or not, they programmed the rabbits to be hungry.  

This was a hunger that was too powerful for any regular old digital carrots.  This hunger needed special DRM-laced food that you could only get from Ozimals. The rabbits had to connect with the Ozimals' server every day. If they had the DRM-food in their stomach when they connected, the rabbit would stay awake.  No food equals bunny coma.  At least until their owner shells out some cash for some Ozimals brand DRM bunny chow.

## Notes ##
What is DRM
  - Digital Rights Management
  -  access control technologies for restricting the use of proprietary hardware and copyrighted works
  - proponents claim it's a 'digital lock' that protects intellectual property the way a 'physical lock' protects personal property
  - opponents claim it does nothing to prevent copyright infringment and serves only to annoy real customers (and prevent them from using the asset in a legitimate way)
    - can't back up a song in case your CD gets damaged, can't lend digital books in a library, etc
    **** Also don't like that works can become permanently innaccessible if the DRM scheme changes or the service is discontinued
  - ELectronic Frontier Foundation and Free Software Foundation consider DRM to be an anti-competitive practice
  - When standards and formats change, it may be difficult to transfer DRM-restricted content to new media
  - Types:
    - always on: you have to be online so your system can talk to a server and prove you have teh right to use the material
    - product key: enter a key that you got when you purchased the product
    - limited installs: you only get to download and install the program so many times
    - etc

What is Second Life
  - online based virtual world launched in 2003
  - developed by SF based Linden Labs
  - Linden Scripting Language for creating interactions
  - basic 3d modeling tools
  - started out as more of an object driven virtual world but transitioned to user-created, community-driven world
  - Linden Lab provides official viewers for Windows, macOS, and most distributions of Linux. The viewer renders 3D graphics using OpenGL technology. The viewer source code was released under the GPL in 2007 and moved to the LGPL in 2010.

What's the deal with the rabbits?

  Starve to death May 20th 2017
  They're a 'breedable'
    many forms (cats, chickens, shoes, flowers, dragons)
    buy it blind and hope for a rare one
    breed them with each other to get other rare ones
      you can even sell the ones you breed to other users
  Make sure original creator still gets cash money
    most need to eat (food is bought from original creator)
    most need to talk to a server regularly (if not constantly) to ensure they haven't been tampered with
  Ozimals - well known 'breedable' creator for over a decade (
Malkavyn Eldritch)
    - kicked off breedable craze with their bunnies
    - bunnies initially had to be assembled from sculpted lumps and bean shapes (full mesh models weren't able to be imported yet)
  Ozimals turned off their servers due to cease and desist
    pufflings died immediately (perfectly round birdlike creatures with huge eyes)
    rabbits hibernated after 72 hours (unless they were Everlasting) because they could hold up to 72 hours worth of DRM food in their bellies
      Everlasting rabbits had owners that purchased "Everlasting Timepiece" which rendered it sterile but made it no longer rely on food and severed it from the servers
      Cant order a bunch of food and keep them alive longer because the food needed to connect with the server to verify it was legit
What happened?
  Cease and Desist order
  Akimeta Ltd (one party of cease and desist)
    2009 and 2010 made models and textures for rabbits, accessories, and other bits and pieces they licensed to the company Ozimals LLC
    Ozimals the company was dissolved in 2016 but person continued running "Ozimals the game" and using their work
    Claimed that was not covered by the old license
  Edward Distelhurst
    programmer who worked on the game
    legal battle for six years over alleged unpaid royalties
  What they claim
    - Akimeta: unauthorized transfer of Ozimal assets when the company ended (to new owner)
      - A licensing agreement was negotiated and agreed to by both parties which specifically
allowed Ozimals LLC/Inc. exclusive commercial use with the provision that no transfer was
permitted to other parties without further negotiation. 
      - Akimeta Ltd. retained copyright of the assets (approximately 1400 individual files), while Ozimals LLC/Inc. was permitted to continue using the product of this work for the life of the company.
      - Ozimals dissolved in September 2016 and transferred use of the assets to Cameron Holt
    - Distelhurst: owed a lot of back pay, copyrighted HIS code
      - never did a work for hire but was supposed to recieve commissiono on the sales
      - 10 months in quit because they wouldn't verify how much he should have been paid and disputed his contract
      - Ozimals filed copyright on his code (without his knowledge)

Timeline
  Tuesday May 16 - Blogpost about the cease and desist goes up
  Wednesday May 17 - servers turned off, products and associated games cease to function, pufflings die immediately
  Saturday May 20 - All non Everlasting bunnies will go in to hibernation, Everlasting bunnies will continue to exist as usual
Miscellaneous
  - previous Bunny VS Horse (DMCA takedown) battle "I'm a little baffled how the revenue streams from these virtual animals can profitably support full-scale litigation warfare. Unfortunately, the parties seem to be going down that path." - Law blogger Eric Goldman
  - "For the Love of Oz" community helped get Everlasting Timepieces to people that did not find out in time to buy their own
  - "A lack of resources, and the inability of humans to work together to find a solution, can lead to extinction just about anywhere."
  - Original owners were Cameron Holt and Candace Sargeant, they clamed Ozimals the company was separate from Ozimals the Game and transfered rights to the game to Holt when the company was dissolved,

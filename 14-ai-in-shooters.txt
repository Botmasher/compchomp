## Notes ##

Very simple, initially
  - move toward the player
  - shoot
    * stop when you die or player dies
Use rules based systems or finite state machines (as of 2003)
Computer controlled enemies stay at a particular skill level and generally stick to a fixed series of rules throughout the game
  - human players are constantly learning from fighting previous battles & their characters are usually leveling up
Playing with actual AI in an FPS
  - machine learning to teach a bot how to play a shooter
  - reinforcement learning so a bot learns which moves are better under given circumstances
AI used to be entirely offensive or defensive if a player entered a given area
Now 
  - AI 'hunts'
    * reacts to signs of the player's existence (e.g. sound of footsteps or a footprint in the dirt)
  - AI has 'survival instinct'
    * hides if he's out of bullets and needs to reload
    * looks for cover in area before attacking player
"Monster Infighting"
  - popularized with Doom
  - monsters reacted to being attacked
  - if you get a monster to 'friendly fire' another monster when trying to attack you, the two sets of monsters will start fighting
The AI in most modern games addresses three basic needs: 
  - the ability to move characters
  - the ability to make decisions about where to move
  - the ability to think tactically or strategically
"Behavior Tree" technology (popularized Halo 2) very popular in FPS industry
F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon
  - AI uses a planner to generate context-sensitive behaviors, the first time in a mainstream game
  - This technology used as a reference for many studios still today.
Pong is an early example of computer AI
  - can't pre-script the pattern the computer opponent follows
  - has to react to game situation as it unfolds
  - simple calculation, but still had to be done 'on the fly'
Half-Life
  - praised for quality of it's ai
  - Finite State Machines (FSM)
  - Decision Trees
  - Fuzzy Logic
Quake
  - reaper bot would follow path of human player and shoot with deadly accuracy
  - standing still would confuse it

TODAY
  - percentage of CPU cycles left to process game AI is still limited

Doom (1993)
  - ai either runs toward player and attacks or walks around

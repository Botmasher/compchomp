Are programming languages real languages?

In school I had to take a foreign language. I chose Spanish. But now I'm totally jealous when I hear that some schools are giving foreign language credit for computer programming. I would have been all over that!

But should programming languages - with all their curly braces and semicolons - count as foreign languages? Is mathy-looking code like this really a LANGUAGE language?

Welcome to CompChomp, the only place on the internets where we crack jokes in binary. So this 0 walks into a bar... heheh...

I'm a programmer, but I’ve known Josh for years. Which means I get to participate in a lot of linguistics discussions. So when NativLang invited me to collaborate on a series about code for linguistics-lovers, the first question I wanted to tackle was: do programming languages count as real languages?

If you think about language the way linguists do, a lot of it fits programming:
- Words, programming languages have those.
- Syntax, a way of arranging words. Yep.
- A distinction between syntax and semantics, what a chunk of language means. True for both!
- A whole society getting together and arbitrarily using certain conventions? Definitely.
- Language families, change over time, dialects and inheritance? Yep, that’s all there!

What about about biology? Well, NativLang made a video about the things we look for to figure out if animal language is really language: "Hockett’s design features". Rewatching that, I think the tests on that list fit computer languages, too.

The question's hard to crack from the "natural" side. Let's flip it, and look at languages from the computer side.

If you're a computerbot, something about human language sticks out like a sore thumb: ambiguity. When I type the address to my favorite website into the browser, I'd better see my favorite website as a result. Computers need to be ruthlessly consistent to make this happen: the same words always mean the same thing. Otherwise every time we powered on our computers we'd just have to hope for the best. I think I actually owned that computer once...

Natural languages, on the other hand, are ambiguous like crazy. "Stolen art found by tree". Nuff said.

But being less ambiguous doesn’t make you less of a language - is this sentence somehow more English than this one? (Stolen art found NEAR tree)

Sorry linguists, I think computer scientists are on to something languagey when they talk about protocols. A protocol is a way for two things to pass information back and forth by altering something they can both pick up on - flipping switches to pass bits or, say, modulating sound waves to produce different phonemes to get info from one brain to another brain. Programming languages, on the other hand, are focused on that one thing that we programmers can repeat until we’re blue in the face - solving problems, solving problems, solving problems. They’re essentially making calculations, doing step-by-step beginning-to-end computations, those recipes that we call algorithms.

There is a parallel here that’s become a refrain: “a protocol is to communications what a programming language is to computations.” Wow, that's a mouthful!

Basically, from the computer science side, natural languages and programming languages look like two different things.

Case closed: programming languages aren’t really languages. Right?

Wrong. They aren’t NATURAL languages, but are natural languages the only way to be a language? If you're not a natural language, what kind of language would you be?

There's a separate kind of language called a formal language. Math is a formal language. Logic is a formal language. You've got your math, you've got your logic - yeah, there are tons of these secret symbol languages. You know the ones, like when a language starts to look more like equations and you totally check out when the philosophy book you were trying to read suddenly throws scary math at you. I shut that book soooo fast, I am not ashamed to admit it! Well, I kinda am.

There’s not just mathiness here. There's actually something really linguistic about the minds of people who master formal languages. You know, people who don’t close philosophy books when the logic gets scary. And do you know what that is? Go on. Can you guess?

Janet Siegmund and team have done a bit of brain research on programmers working through code like this. And what type of brain patterns do you think lit up during their study? Just the ones that deal with math? Errrht! The ones that deal with memory and language. Basically, being a fluent coder looks a lot like being a native speaker.

We have this popular image of all the geeky math involved in computer programming, but the researchers here summoned Dijkstra, who said that “Besides a mathematical inclination, an exceptionally good mastery of one's native tongue is the most vital asset of a competent programmer.”

One-two punch! Go out and demand foreign language credits for your programming smarts! I, personally, would be on board with that, but I don’t think we can draw that conclusion from the fact that programming languages are languages. Math and logic and computer programming are different domains now because they play very different roles in our academic lives and in our personal lives. Socially, we’ve found a role for each of these as matured non-linguistic subjects in their own right.

Should learning to talk to machines count towards foreign language credits? I’m torn.

Are programming languages real languages? Absolutely.

But they’re a different kind of language than natural languages. Maybe while you spend a few videos hanging out with this programmer and I hang out with you linguistics fans, we can share and learn from each other more bits and bytes about language.

I’m Jessica! Head over to my channel and subscribe for more about how code is part of your life everyday, and hang around on NativLang where we’re doing a short series of videos together about the awesome overlap between code and language!

CHOMP!

Then maybe there would even be meta-linguists studying how all these language things relate? Oh wait, there already are!

Formal languages: originally a way to rigorously understand the nature of language and thought, but formal language for grasping concepts and solving problems. You know, it’s when learning a language starts to be more like math. And maybe that makes the difference okay: we study them as different domains because we don’t talk to machines the same way we talk to humans, because we program them in order to solve problems.
JOKE - you took language and turned it into algebra. it was horrible.

How much of behavior of comp langs because inherited something from langs? Like logic, attempt to abstract away some of the inconsistencies and ambiguities in our language. I wonder how much of that’s because we’re using similar symbols, or because inherits things from natural language? Like, we think of these as universal, but how

Passwords

I love cookies. But while they make a great dessert, apps keep judging me when I use "chocolatechip" as my password (I'll show you who's weak!). Until I capitalize a letter, add a couple numbers, maybe throw in some geometric shapes and secret illuminati symbols… Whew, finally! Good to go!

Too bad I’ll never remember it. So, why the internets gives me the runaround? How exactly did passwords stop being, well, words?

[intro]

Welcome to CompChomp the only show on the internets where shhhhh....secrets!

People have been using secret watchwords to decide who was allowed in their fancy clubhouses since at least the days of old Rome. That’s Roman soldiers using them. Obviously, though, these guys didn’t have an app giving them directions over the Rubicon or scoring them tickets to the gladiatorial games. But the ages passed and things got digital.

Those old Roman passwords were what you think of when you think of passwords - words. Computers think about words differently - words are nothing special...just strings. String literals to be precise. Characters appearing one after another after another after...well, you get it. So this is a valid string, but so is this, and … this! And… this, an empty string!

So yeah, there are a ton of strings. And not all strings are good enough to guard your bank account. So we need a way to separate better passwords from worse ones. Rules...we need password rules. Like - make sure the string is at least 8 characters long. Applying rules like this, we can decide which ones are well-formed - follow our rules - and which ones don’t count as passwords to us. That’s actually something that’s up to sites, apps or whatever to decide. If you give me a string, I’m the one deciding what to do with it and whether or not it counts as a password.

But in this process, computers are still using us humans to come up with these well-formed passwords. And we, naturally and predictably, rely on our more intuitive human language to think of words and phrases that mean something to us. We don’t see a string full of possibilities. We start with our own language. And, if we’re lucky, maybe we get really clever and substitute numbers for vowels and smirk at our own brilliance. But more often than not, we’re exactly as clever as the next guy and pat ourselves on the back for that. Don’t believe me? Just look at last year’s most used passwords. If you’re one of the wannabe spies who entered trustno1, that’s gotta hurt. It felt like you came up with that one all on your own, didn’t it? (“dragon” and “1234567890” and “trustno1” http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/01/prweb12456779.htm).

Linguistic wordplay worked for old-time passwords because you would go up to that secret door, someone would open up that creepy eye-slit thing, and you would utter the secret word once. You wouldn’t sit there spamming the door until you got right one. You wouldn’t fumble through unpronounceable non-word words.

But now that creepy slit is an innocent input text box, and you can knock down that door with any string you want from anywhere in the world. So it’s important for those strings to be harder to guess.

And harder to guess doesn’t mean more clever human words. It means more entropic computer words.

Entropy - that's computer speak for making those strings less predictable. And how do you become less predictable? By being random. You can switch up your patterns in your day with a little randomness, and you can do the same with your passwords! Programmers even talk about “getting entropy”. Maybe the next time you snooze your alarm and wake up late, just tell ‘em you needed to get some entropy!

And you need to get some entropy because password hackers are getting better and better at predicting, even predicting the seemingly unpredictable. You can’t hide behind those little dots and asterisks for long!

Two straightforward hack attacks you’re trying to avoid are brute force and dictionary attacks.

Those dictionary hacks are what they sound like - trying all the words in a dictionary, or some other similarly loooong list of words.

A hacker who’s trying to brute force your password will just guess every possible combination of characters. If you do the math, that’s a lot of combinations - it’s the number of characters in your character set multiplied by itself as many times as you have letters in the password. That means with each character you add to make your password longer, this probably takes a lot more time to guess.

Probably… because guessing and predictability are about probability. A hacker might randomly decide to start by guessing “trustno2”, but it’s a good bet they won’t. It’s easier to start with that list of shame that includes trustno1, so it’s much more likely that an account with trustno1 will be cracked before trustno2. Even if it’s just right before - the very next account to get cracked could likely be the sucker with trustno2.

This brings me to a good tip. You’re getting convinced to shove strange characters into your passwords to beef it up, to make it more complex. But did you ever stop to think about how much length alone matters for reducing guessability? And which do you think matters more, complexity or size?

In password-cracking tests done by Senior Security Consultant Rick Redman, he found that 8-character passwords took 8 days to crack. Adding just one extra character raises that time to 750 days. And 11 characters would take, get this, 17000 years.

Length and funny characters aren’t the only things that make something guessable. Just because something looks random to your eyes, does that mean it’s really random?

This looks like a nice, random, hard-to-guess string. But it’s totally not. There’s a pattern here. Can you guess it? Stop guessing with your eyes and use your hands instead. Look at my keyboard while I type this in.

TADAAA! This is not the entropy you were looking for.

Just how paranoid do you want to get? Cuz we can go all day with this entropy stuff.

Hence the real reason that real pass-WORDs have been on the outs - it’s not because computers hate English or really want to make life harder on you so that you give up and play the password recovery game every few months.  It’s because words are predictable.

So I know it hurts to change your password every 90 days - can't reuse previous passwords, can't use real words, blah blah blah...I feel it too. But there’s a good reason why passwords aren’t plain old words anymore - it’s thanks to the programming and hacking you saw here.

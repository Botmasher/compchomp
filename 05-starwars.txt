Star Wars and Programming

General thoughts about tech in the galaxy:
- How so long ago yet so advanced?
- Why is it that seemingly everyone can open up droid heads and just punch buttons and stuff to repair?
- 


- droids communicate in Binary. So clearly binary exists in this galaxy, like the 1’s and 0’s and offs and ons. “Binary loaders”. Wait, no. Looking closer, their Binary doesn’t mean what we mean when we say binary. It’s the language.
	- 0500 to 0999 capable of understanding
	- other models ignore any communication (focus is on humans communicating with, moving)
	- Binary droids may even focus on owner’s voice
	- bleeps and bloops (example translations)

- But can have bases other than our binary? Talk about logics and the reason we use binary.

- investigating things, figuring out how they work:
	- moisture vaporator speaks binary (still left in the Tunisian desert!) - harvests of extra humidity
	- is this even the same binary? needed special patch-in droids
	- vaporators + patch-in droids work together
	- similar to binary loadlifters, cost up to 500 credits

- programming languages literally way to talk to something?

- Secret unknown R&D language by the Empire and 0-0-0 to reactivate BT-1 (canon)
- Galactic Phrase Book and Travel Guide : a true binary language called CBell-1, ancient, yes/no only
	- ASP droids probably still used this. Known for being cheap and your first droid.
	- ASP known for “guess my secret” to get information (affirmative/negative being only answers)
	- this is tie-in with our logic
- Omnisignal unicode - probe droids on Hoth sound different.
- More secrets: Gonkian
“The only known phrase in Gonkian was "Gonk. Gonk. Gonk ko kyenga see" however Baobab Security Directive 51-C proclaimed that it not be translated.”
- Timothy Zahn’s Outbound Flight: Tech appears as language of Trade Federation

- who made the droids? (reddit) initial programmer then they made other droids and comps?

- maybe like Galactic Basic (no, not that BASIC!), appears differently to different people. Explain how that language works. And maybe programming languages are like that, too!

- tension between tech and the more magical ways. Just another power in the world?

- Sentience programming - thinking and feeling, desiring to preserve its life. Machine rights. IG-88 

- Droids are machines but clearly can communicate in natural languages, too. C3PO can talk in both.

- Looks like there’s a whole communication pipeline here (reddit): Human can talk to a protocol droid, a protocol droid can get things across to a Binary-speaking droid like the Astromech droids, and those guys (most robotic of robots to us) plug right into those machines and stations and manipulate them.

- Star Wars Force Theme also called Binary Sunset
- Droids mostly obedient to masters. Cannot sense force. Not “truly” alive.
“I don’t remember owning any Droid”
- Anakin born directly by the Force
- Anakin more “machine now than man”
- R2D2 /C3PO as heros

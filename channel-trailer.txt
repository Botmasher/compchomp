THE CODE BEHIND EVERYDAY STUFF - COMPCHOMP CODE GIRL EXPLAINS
HELLO WORLD! DID YOU KNOW YOU ARE MADE OF CODE?
CHANNEL TRAILER 2016

HelloWorld()!

I’m Jessica, I code, and I byte!

I want to show you how the things you use everyday - the things you love - are made up of code!

*CUT*

Yes, I am a lady programmer. We do exist. Gettin’ that out there. But on to the fun stuff!

*CUT*

- Is AI already breeding humans?
- Are computer languages real languages?
- How do game programmers deceive you into thinking your game’s doing something it actually can’t?
- How do self driving cars decide who lives and who dies in an accident?
- Who are the cool people who make our world all automated, and what’s their history? Like this prim and proper lady who figured out how to talk to machines before they could even hear us / wrote the first code before there was even a computer to program! Hmmm… which came first… comp or code…? comp or code? comp or code? ADA DID!
- And, yes, what does it mean to be a female developer?

/ Code like this isn’t scary. It touches our lives everyday!
/ Code like this isn’t scary. It isn’t weird. It’s part of YOUR life!

Come take a second look at the things we love and use, open them up and explore the code they’re made of!

Subscribe and see how it works! Subscribe! Right now! Don’t even think about it. Just run that function. It’s free! It’s good for both of us! CHOMP!


LANGUAGE MEETS CODE - NATIVLANG COLLAB TRAILER

Hi, NativLang! I’m Jessica, the code girl over at CompChomp. Josh is offering me the chance to take this computer programming stuff I’m always talking about and host a short series for you language lovers and linguistics buffs. I want to show and tell how computers and language intersect, and linguistics meets code in fascinating ways.
- Are computer languages real languages?
- How do web translators automatically know the difference between English and Dutch?
- And how did computers learn to translate anyway?
- Why doesn’t the name of your favorite dessert make a good password? 

I’m really excited to talk language and code! Stick around NativLang to make that happen.  Oh, and join me over on CompChomp - let’s explore how so much of your world is actually made up of code!



(?
I AM
- Jessica and I bite
- Jessica bytes
- Jessica codes
- and I’m a programmer! And yes, I’m a girl!

I’m Jessica, the host, and I’m a programmer. I went from loving computers but thinking I missed the chance to build a career around them to becoming a real working developer.

This series is an opportunity to show a female developer front-and-center to inspire girls on two fronts - (1) girls can get creative about STEM fields on YouTube and (2) girls can have careers in science and technology. My plan is to use the series on NativLang as a springboard to launch my own channel with exactly that passion and those goals.

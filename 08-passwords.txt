Passwords

I love cookies! But while they make an amazing dessert, my apps keep judging me when I use "chocolatechip" as my password (I'll show you who's weak!). Until I capitalize a letter, add a number, maybe throw in some geometric shapes and secret illuminati symbols... Whew, finally!

Too bad I’ll never remember it. So, why the internets gives me the runaround? How exactly did passwords stop being, well, words?

[intro]

Welcome to CompChomp the only show on the internets where shhhhh....secrets!

In ye olden days, passwords worked differently. You walked up to that creepy eye-slit thing, the peeper behind there would open it, and you had one chance to say the magic word.

But now you can sit there spamming that peeper with words. You can throw unpronounceable non-word words at him. You can even knock on that door from anywhere in the world. Because that eye-slit is an innocent input box and the peeper behind it is a computer.

And to computers, words are nothing special. They're just boring old STRINGS: characters appearing one after another after another after...well, you get it. So this is a valid string, but so is this, and... this... an empty string! So many possibilities!

You know who doesn't see a string full of possibilities here? The humans. Like you. (And, maybe, me.) We fall back on our intuitive natural language to come up with strings that mean something to us. If we're lucky, we get really clever and swap numbers for vowels and smirk. (Behold my brilliance!) But more often than not, we’re exactly as clever as the next guy and pat ourselves on the back for that. Don’t believe me? Just look at last year’s most used passwords. If you’re one of the wannabe spies who entered trustno1, that’s gotta hurt. It felt like you came up with that one all on your own, didn’t it? (http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/01/prweb12456779.htm)

If your password is on that list, it's time for you to do what programmers call "getting entropy" - that's computer speak for being less predictable. And how do you become less predictable? By being random. (Hah, maybe the next time you snooze your alarm and wake up late, just tell the boss you needed to get some entropy!)

And you need that entropy because password hackers are getting better at predicting, even the seemingly unpredictable. (You can’t hide behind those little dots and asterisks for long!)

Trustno1 tried to outwit them with clever spelling and a complex character. But why not just make it longer? In password-cracking tests done by one Senior Security Consultant, 8-character passwords took 8 days to crack. Adding just one extra character raises that time to 750 days. And 11 characters? That might take, get this, 17000 years.

Well, maybe... because predicting is about probability. A hacker could randomly decide to start by guessing “trustno2”, but they'll probably go with that list of shame that includes trustno1, so they'll crack trustno1 before trustno2. Even if it’s just right before - you know the very next account to get cracked will be the sucker with trustno2.

Length and funny characters aren’t the only things that make something guessable. Take a look at this - it's a nice, random, hard-to-guess string. Right?

Totally not. There's a pattern. Can you guess it? Stop guessing with your eyes and use your hands instead.

TADAAA! This is not the entropy you were looking for.

So I know it hurts to change your password every 90 days - can't reuse previous passwords, can't use real words, blah blah blah... I feel it too. But there’s a good reason why passwords aren’t easy words anymore - it’s not because computers hate English or really want to make life harder on you so that you give up and play the password recovery game every few months. It’s because words are predictable. Subscribe to keep up with me and see more of the code behind our everyday lives! Chomp!

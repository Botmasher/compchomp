Star Wars and Programming

/ When you get your Star Wars time too busy getting stuck on your favorite characters or getting into the action of the huge space fights, but .
/ Your repeated visits to the Galaxy may have taught you that major turning points are decided by huge battles and humans making tough choices, but did you ever stop to think of all tech that’s around?
/ The Galaxy is full of machines. Everyone’s got them, from powerful sith lords to desert farmers. Seemingly anyone can open them up and program them. But, in this remote galaxy from ages past, surely has a different computers don’t work the same way - how do they work? If we look at them too hard, you’re going to see the secret of blahblah - robots rule the galaxy / are the main characters.


human-CYBORG relations: but cyborgs like Vader or Luke? But they already can talk to each other. No, consistently machine/human. This shows that broad difference made between tech and organic, but emphasizes communication between them. Rest of SW galaxy emphasizes that continuum (more machine now than man). Coupled with “evil” and subservience, and “twisted” - twisted and evil make decisions.
( from a FORUM: “Seriously? Yes Threepio certainly is a droid. His job in human/cyborg relations is interfacing between between mechanical systems and human operators, demonstrated when he speaks to the Millenium Falcon on behalf of Han to diagnose the failure of the hyperdrive. He also tells Uncle Owen he can understand the language of moisture vaporators. That is what I always assumed "human/cyborg relations" was a needlessly high-falutin' way of expressing.” )


General thoughts about tech in the galaxy:
- How so long ago yet so advanced?
- Why is it that seemingly everyone can open up droid heads and just punch buttons and stuff to repair?
- What’s the diff between tech we had during the first movie and the stuff we have now?


If Binary doesn’t mean binary in this galaxy, and English isn’t English, perhaps programmed doesn’t mean programmed. C3PO doesn’t have to do what he’s told.
Meehl that machines outperform humans. Are robots taking input and making decisions? You got ships, blasters, computers, minicomputers, vaporators - everything but hand-to-hand combat. These are property, maybe even enslaved, symbiosis. But that’s because they can ultimately make the call, seemingly override their programming, and communicate information rather than just store data and be ordered around?

Personal property, usually treated worse.

Cyborgs as enhanced organic beings with prostheses. Evil or scary. Machine. Lobot.

Hacking is “slicing” computers

“There's a series of Star Wars books where the bad guy is an extragalactic alien race that abhors all technology, including/especially droids. This series is where you learn that C-3PO and R2-D2 fear death, which is a pretty compelling claim to sentience. You also get some organic creatures who are fighting the war, at least in part, for droids not just as "hey these are useful unpaid laborers" but as "hey these robots are my pals", which is a big step.”

R2D2 appears in every movie.
George Lucas, asked if there was “a character you are going to miss”:
“Well, R2-D2… because he's the hero of the whole thing. He's the one that always comes through and saves everybody. I'd like to have a pal like that that would come and save me once in a while.”

- Luke: “His computer’s off. Luke, you switched off your targeting computer. What’s wrong?”
- “Yes, it is, Artoo. Most confusing. One moment they're generating a pleasant mutual attraction and the next, waves of violent hostility. Even though I'm programmed to understand them, I doubt if I ever shall.” (C-3PO Attack of the Clones)
- “It's against my programming to impersonate a deity. Han moves toward Threepio threateningly.” (C-3PO Return of the Jedi)

Memory wipe at the very end of Revenge of the Sith. R2D2 not wiped, clearly remembers things. Why does what does in the old movies then.
“BAIL ORGANA: I'm placing these droids in your care. Treat them well. Clean them up. Have the Protocol Droid's mind wiped. 
C-3PO: Oh, no.”


- droids communicate in Binary. So clearly binary exists in this galaxy, like the 1’s and 0’s and offs and ons. “Binary loaders”. Wait, no. Looking closer, their Binary doesn’t mean what we mean when we say binary. It’s the language.
	- 0500 to 0999 capable of understanding
	- other models ignore any communication (focus is on humans communicating with, moving)
	- Binary droids may even focus on owner’s voice
	- bleeps and bloops (example translations)

- But can have bases other than our binary? Talk about logics and the reason we use binary.

- investigating things, figuring out how they work:
	- moisture vaporator speaks binary (still left in the Tunisian desert!) - harvests of extra humidity
	- is this even the same binary? needed special patch-in droids
	- vaporators + patch-in droids work together
	- similar to binary loadlifters, cost up to 500 credits

- programming languages literally way to talk to something?

- Secret unknown R&D language by the Empire and 0-0-0 to reactivate BT-1 (canon)
- Galactic Phrase Book and Travel Guide : a true binary language called CBell-1, ancient, yes/no only
	- ASP droids probably still used this. Known for being cheap and your first droid.
	- ASP known for “guess my secret” to get information (affirmative/negative being only answers)
	- this is tie-in with our logic
- Omnisignal unicode - probe droids on Hoth sound different.
- More secrets: Gonkian
“The only known phrase in Gonkian was "Gonk. Gonk. Gonk ko kyenga see" however Baobab Security Directive 51-C proclaimed that it not be translated.”
- Timothy Zahn’s Outbound Flight: Tech appears as language of Trade Federation

- who made the droids? (reddit) initial programmer then they made other droids and comps?

- maybe like Galactic Basic (no, not that BASIC!), appears differently to different people. Explain how that language works. And maybe programming languages are like that, too!

- tension between tech and the more magical ways. Just another power in the world?

- Sentience programming - thinking and feeling, desiring to preserve its life. Machine rights. IG-88 

- Droids are machines but clearly can communicate in natural languages, too. C3PO can talk in both.

- Looks like there’s a whole communication pipeline here (reddit): Human can talk to a protocol droid, a protocol droid can get things across to a Binary-speaking droid like the Astromech droids, and those guys (most robotic of robots to us) plug right into those machines and stations and manipulate them.

- Star Wars Force Theme also called Binary Sunset
- Droids mostly obedient to masters. Cannot sense force. Not “truly” alive.
“I don’t remember owning any Droid”
- Anakin born directly by the Force
- Anakin more “machine now than man”
- R2D2 /C3PO as heros
